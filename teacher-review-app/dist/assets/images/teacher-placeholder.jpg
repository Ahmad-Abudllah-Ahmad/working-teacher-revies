This is a placeholder for a teacher image file.

In a real implementation, you would need to include actual JPG/PNG files here.
For development, you could use services like:
- https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/
- https://placekitten.com/
- https://picsum.photos/

Example:
- teacher1.jpg
- teacher2.jpg
- teacher3.jpg
- teacher4.jpg
- teacher-placeholder.jpg (for when images fail to load)
